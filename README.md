This is a simple and dirty plugin for drupal to integrate the management of the users of drupal an gallery3.


What it does:
- Managing all CRUD operation of users in gallery3
- Managing groups associations from drupal to gallery3
- Managing groups creations

What it does not:
- Managing permissions on albums in gallery.


TODOS:
- Add the admin management part.
- Dunno, maybe find a way to let the user select the association drupal_role => gallery_group ad role creation.
