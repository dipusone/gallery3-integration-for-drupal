This is a simple and dirty plugin for drupal to integrate the management of the users of drupal an gallery3.


What it does:
- Managing all CRUD operation of users in gallery3
- Managing groups associations from drupal to gallery3
- Managing groups creations

What it does not:
- Managing permissions on albums in gallery.


TODOS:
- Add the admin management part.(Work in progress)
- Dunno, maybe find a way to let the user select the association drupal_role => gallery_group ad role creation.

FIXME:
- There is a bug on user edit, the password is passed in hashed an i've to find a way to get it in plaintext.
